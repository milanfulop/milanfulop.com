        7 years ago, my brother Martin introduced me to programming. Since then, I've participated in national competitions, workshops, team projects, while learning (and failing) a lot. Programming has immensely influenced the way I approached real-life problems as I've grown up. 
        <br/><br/>
        I'm 17 now, and I can confidently say computers have changed my life for the better. It not only has given me the tools to build software, but to build my future: the love, experiences and discoveries that await.
        <br/><br/>
        Over the past few years, I've been exploring how ideas actually turn into reality. I used to run a blog pointing out ui/ux mistakes made by technical founders, while offering actionable solution in a digestible way. Although the blog was short lived, it managed to inspire people to fix issues I highlighted.
        <br/><br/>
        Even though I haven't built anything that's reached a wider audience yet, I often see my past work guiding me toward my next steps.
        <br/><br/>
        I believe that every key I've pressed, every word I've written, every mistake I've made, and every wave of uncertainty I've faced will ultimately shape me into the person my subconscious self wants me to become.
        <br/><br/>
        Into someone that's truly authentic to me.
